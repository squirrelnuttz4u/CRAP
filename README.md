Welcome to CRAP 3.0: The AI-Native IDE
CRAP 3.0 represents a fundamental rethinking of the development process. It's an AI-native environment designed from the ground up to be the ultimate tool for developers working in a true partnership with artificial intelligence. It moves beyond simple code completion to become a self-contained, intelligent workspace that understands your entire project.

Built on a local-first philosophy, CRAP 3.0 seamlessly integrates with your local Ollama server, giving you the power of a next-generation AI like Gemini with the privacy and speed of running on your own hardware.

What's New in 3.0?
CRAP 3.0 introduces a suite of powerful new features designed to create a fluid, intelligent, and highly productive "vibe coding" experience.

Core Intelligence: The RAG Engine
Project-Wide Context: The new Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system is the heart of CRAP 3.0. The AI now has a deep, searchable memory of every file you add to the File Browser, allowing it to understand your entire project's architecture and provide incredibly context-aware answers and code.

Smarter Chat: Follow-up questions, project-level refactoring, and complex bug analysis are now possible, as the AI can reason about your entire codebase, not just a single file.

The Reactive Notebook
Automatic Execution: The notebook is now truly reactive. When you modify a code cell, CRAP 3.0 automatically builds a dependency graph and re-runs only the cells that are affected by your change. This creates a live, fluid environment where you see the impact of your work in real-time.

Enhanced Cell Controls: Cells are now fully resizable, and you can easily mark any code cell as a test with a single click, streamlining the Test-Driven Development workflow.

The "Vibe Check": Your AI Partner
AI-Powered Refactoring: Right-click any code cell and select "Vibe Check: Refactor Code". The AI will act as a senior engineer, analyzing your code for errors, inefficiencies, and code smells, and then rewrite it to be more performant and readable.

Automated Docs & Tests: You can now right-click a function or class and have the AI automatically generate comprehensive unit tests or a professional-grade docstring for it.

A Complete IDE Experience
Integrated Terminal: A full-featured terminal is now docked at the bottom of the window, allowing you to run shell commands, manage Git, and interact with your system without ever leaving the application.

Integrated Debugger: A proper debugging panel allows you to step through code, inspect variables, and manage breakpoints, turning the notebook into a professional-grade debugging environment.

The Scratchpad: Inspired by modern AI canvases, the new Scratchpad panel is your personal workspace for collecting and editing code snippets from the AI Chat before using them in your notebook.
